# Hero vs Zombies

## How to Run
Because this game loads local assets (images), you cannot simply open `index.html` in your browser. You must run a local web server.

### Option 1: Python (Recommended)
You can use Python's built-in HTTP server (already installed on your Mac).
1. Open your terminal in this directory.
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
3. Open your browser to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Option 2: VS Code Live Server
If you are using VS Code:
1. Install the "Live Server" extension.
2. Right-click on `index.html`.
3. Select "Open with Live Server".
